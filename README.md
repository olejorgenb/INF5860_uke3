# INF5860_uke3

Get the code with the exercises with:

    git clone https://github.com/sigmunjr/INF5860_uke3.git

This week you will write your code in the files **INF5860_uke3.ipynb** and **classification.py**.

To begin start a jupyter notebook by running:

    jupyter notebook INF5860_uke3.ipynb

If you are on a UiO computer and don't have jupyter, you can run:

    /ifi/asgard/a05/sigmunjr/Public/jupyter notebook INF5860_uke3.ipynb


from the project folder *INF5860_uke3*.

If the browser does not open, you can go to the url: [http://localhost:8888/notebooks/INF5860_uke3.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/INF5860_uke3.ipynb)
For the rest of the exercise you can just read the notebook. To see the notebook without running it (you cannot run code), you can go to [https://github.com/sigmunjr/INF5860_uke3/blob/master/INF5860_uke3.ipynb](https://github.com/sigmunjr/INF5860_uke3/blob/master/INF5860_uke3.ipynb).
